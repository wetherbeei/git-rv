## Git Rietveld code review tool

git-rv is a code review tool for uploading and downloading code reviews to a 
Rietveld server (such as codereview.appspot.com).

It allows for creating new code reviews from feature branches, so it works best
on workflows where each branch is a new feature containing one commit. Multiple
commits per branch are allowed, but the commit message from the latest commit
will be used in the code review message.

    $ git checkout master
    $ git checkout -b feature1
    <edits>
    $ git commit
    <detailed commit message>

## git rv review

Upload a local branch to be reviewed. If the current branch is dependent upon 
another branch in review, the branch in review will be used as the base for the
diff.

    $ git checkout feature1
    $ git rv review

## git rv test

Download a code review into a local branch for testing. Commit details will be
taken from the code review description in Rietveld.

    $ git rv test [issuenum]
    or
    $ git rv test [issuenum]/[patchnum]
    $ git branch
    *  issue/[issuenum]/[patchnum]
